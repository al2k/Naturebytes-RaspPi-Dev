The Naturebytes Wildlife Cam Kit is a motion-sensitive, wildlife camera that anyone can build to remotely capture high definition photos and videos of wildlife. The kit is powered by the Raspberry Pi, a credit-card-sized programmable computer, making it a fun way to develop your digital making skills and provide an exciting new insight into the natural world around you.

Our Wildlife Cam Cases come as part of the Kit or can be bought separately. The cases are specifically designed to be weatherproof and can protect your tech from exposure to the elements.

Build it, set it up outdoors and share your wildlife images online with the Naturebytes community.
